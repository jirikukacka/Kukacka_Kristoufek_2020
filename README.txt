ATTACHED FILES: mmc2.csv (for BTC), mmc3.csv (for SP).

Content of mmc1.R:
- Functions used in the manuscript, needed for estimation of the multifractal spectrum.
- Two illustrative examples:
  - Illustrative example of a multifractal series. Binomial multifractal model (Feder, J. 1988. Fractals, Plenum Press, NY, USA) is used.
  - Empirical example as given in the manuscript, here for BTC. Can be used for S&P500 as well.
- A specimen of the Monte Carlo simulation study utilized in the manuscript to produce Fig. 4-type chart. Computational setup trivialized for personal computers. The original setup for a cluster computation is given in Section 4.1.

abstract = {Agent-based models are usually claimed to generate complex dynamics; however, the link to such complexity has not been subject to rigorous examination. This paper studies this link between the complexity of financial time series—measured by their multifractal properties—and the design of various small-scale agent-based frameworks used to model the heterogeneity of financial markets. Nine popular models are analyzed, and while some of the models do not generate interesting multifractal patterns, we observe the strongest tendency towards multifractal behavior for the Bornholdt Ising model, the discrete choice-based models by Gaunersdorfer & Hommes and Schmitt & Westerhoff, and the transition probabilities-based framework by Franke & Westerhoff. Complexity is thus not an automatic feature of the time series generated by any agent-based model but generated only by models with specific properties. In addition, because multifractality is considered a financial stylized fact, its presence can be used as a new means to validate such models.}
